# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV["MY_APP_DATABASE_URL"] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: backend_production
  username: <%= ENV["BACKEND_DATABASE_USERNAME"] %>
  password: <%= ENV["BACKEND_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
  host: <%= ENV["BACKEND_DATABASE_HOST"] || "localhost" %>
